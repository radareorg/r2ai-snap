# R2ai snap repository

[![snap: r2ai](https://snapcraft.io/r2ai/badge.svg "snap latest stable version")](https://snapcraft.io/r2ai)

This repository contains the recipie to build the snap version of [r2ai](https://github.com/radareorg/r2ai) for the original implementation of the AI support for radare2 written in Python.

Although it is considered deprecated, it's still useful and aims to be maintained, but we recommend using decai or the C rewrite as alternatives (both included in the [radare2 snap](https://snapcraft.io/radare2)).

[![Get it from the Snap Store](https://snapcraft.io/static/images/badges/en/snap-store-black.svg)](https://snapcraft.io/r2ai)
